Functionality

This plugin is based on the css_color plugin by Nikolaus Hofer. The idea is to
highlight color names and codes in the same color that they represent.

The plugin understands the W3-Colors (used for CSS files for example), the
Color names from the X11 Window System and also codes in hex notation, like
#FF0000 (which represents Red in the RGB color system). Additionally, it
supports the CSS color specifications, e.g. rgb(RR,GG,BB) color representation
in either absolutely values or as percentage and also the HVL Color
representation like hvl(H,V,L)

It works best in the gui version of Vim, but the plugin also supports 256 and
88 color terminals and translates the colors to those supported by the
terminal. 16 and 8 color terminals should work theoretically too, but hasn't
been widely tested. Note, that translating the colors to the terminal might
impose a performance penalty, depending on the terminal type and the number of
matches in the file.

This plugin defines the following commands:

                                                                 *:ColorCodes*
:[range]ColorCodes[!]       Scan the lines given by [range] for color codes
                            names and highlight those. If [range] is omitted,
                            the whole file will be scanned. If the ! is used,
                            the plugin will redefine all highlighting groups.

                                                                 *:NoColor*
:NoColor                    Turn off Color highlighting.

                                                                 *:Rgb2Xterm*
:Rgb2Xterm #RRGGBB          Translate the color code given as argument to a
                            the closest color, that can be displayed by the
                            terminal. Note, the color must be given in the
                            format #RRGGBB (a '#' followed by the hex format
                            of the colors reg, green and blue)

                                                                *:HSL2RGB*
:HSL2RGB hsl(h,v,l)         Translate the HVL color defined by the string
                            'hsl(h,v%,l%)' into a color that the current
                            terminal can display. Note, that the color must be
                            given in the format 'hsl(HH, V, L)' where HH
                            defines the Hue as absolute value between 0 and
                            255 and V and L represent a percentage for value
                            and Lightness.


2 Colorizer Configuration                                    Colorizer-config*
------------------------

2.1 Automatic loading                                       *Colorizer-auto*
---------------------
The Colorizer plugin can be configured to automatically load when opening a
new file. Note, that this might slow down the loading process, especially on
the terminal. To enable this, simply the the variable 'g:auto_color' to 1,
e.g. by defining it in your |.vimrc| >

    :let g:auto_color = 1
<

2.2 Use X11 color names                                     *Colorizer-names*
-----------------------

Colorizer can be configured to support all color names, defined by the X11
Window System. By default it only supports the colors defined by the W3C for
the CSS Specification. To use the X11 color names, set the variable
'g:color_x11_names' to 1, e,g. in your |.vimrc| >

    let g:color_x11_names = 1
<
